# appformik
- Appformik is for me to learn basics of integrating Formik with React and Yup for validation. 
- Create-react-app has been used to create the boilerplate of the project.

# Framework and Modules 
1. react && react-dom
2. formik
3. yup  
#### $yarn add formik yup

# To get started
- clone the repo using: $git clone <url>
- Navigate to the project folder <appformik> and in the terminal use:
  - a $yarn install OR $npm install // to install all the dependencies for the project
  -  $yarn start OR $npm start // run the development server
